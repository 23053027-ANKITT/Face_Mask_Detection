# Face Mask Detection using Custom CNN

This project implements a face mask detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built from scratch with TensorFlow and OpenCV.

## Project Status
- Dataset collection and preprocessing completed
- Train–validation split implemented
- Custom CNN architecture designing in progress

## Technologies Used (so far)
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and is not included in this repository due to size constraints.
